Back in 2004 (well before I joined), Agilent had bought a company called Silicon Genetics that made a product called GeneSpring. The product was a uniquely powerful multivariate statistical analysis software for DNA microarray data, which was popular at the time. The platform was very capable and so we had some early support for proteomics data, where users could perform statistical analysis on peptide expression measurements from shotgun proteomics experiments.

The Silicon Genetics platform had some "age" to it and some significant usability issues, and so in 2007, Agilent partnered with Strand Life Sciences to use Strand's more modern statistical analysis platform and port over functionality from GeneSpring. In 2008, I was assigned to lead an effort to design a mass spectrometry based metabolomics & proteomics workflow for the new GeneSpring. This software would become core to my responsibilities for the next 10 years.
